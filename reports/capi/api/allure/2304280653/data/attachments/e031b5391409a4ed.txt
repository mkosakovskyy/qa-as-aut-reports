            "contentBody": "On Sunday, August 30, former Spanish prime minister Felipe González published an open letter in EL PAÍS titled “<a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/30/inenglish/1440940912_708978.html\">To the Catalans</a>.” I feel a personal affection for González, and have always been thankful for his respectful, attentive attitude.\nLogically, we cannot agree on everything. For instance, I feel that he should have left out the reference to 1930s Germany and Italy in his article. Besides making himself an easy target for criticism and allowing people to focus on the finger of blame rather than the issue at hand, González’s remark hurt a lot of people’s feelings, including my own.\nIncidentally, less than a month ago a member of Catalan premier Artur Mas’s government likened Spain to old Communist Germany, and nobody criticized that remark.\nBut the former statesman’s positions and ideas still count for something in Spain, Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world. Thus the relevance of his views on the delicate situation in Catalonia, where <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/10/inenglish/1415577606_989753.html\">part of the population supports severing all ties with Spain</a>.\nThat is why I propose to comment on some of his thoughts while reminding readers about my own political genetics. The stature of Felipe González makes it unnecessary to remind anyone about his own political beliefs.\nI am, above and beyond any other circumstance, a person grounded in the ideas of community personalism. There is no nation without people. I put people, personal dignity and collective raison d’être ahead of everything else. From this starting point, I feel moderately proud of having contributed, if minimally, to the economic, political and social progress of Catalonia and all of Spain.\nUnfortunately, pitting Catalonia against Spain and vice versa is a good way of getting votes\nTrue, I would like this Spain to be different in many ways. Among other things, I would like to see the acknowledgment of diversity as a shared asset – which González’s article mentions – paving the way for a true expression of the country’s national, cultural and linguistic diversity.\nThe European project flows through my political veins, and while I was never pro-independence, with every passing day I am increasingly aware of the inter-dependence that Catalonia must adapt to, considering the connections imposed by globalization.\nFinally, but no less importantly, I have tried to make dialogue the main currency of politics. In his article, Felipe González talks about understanding one another. This has always been necessary, but more so now than ever. Dialogue, pacts and deals. Were we not able to reach agreements following Franco’s death? Is our current starting point worse now than it was then? Honestly, I think not.\nFor years I added my voice to <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/17/inenglish/1434558384_742507.html\">the long-ruling coalition that was Convergència i Unió (CiU)</a> to underscore that, thanks to the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and our first regional autonomy charter, Catalonia has experienced more progress in terms of economy, social issues and self-rule than at any other time in its thousand-year existence. I never once regretted having defended and voted for this institutional framework.\nThe only way forward is a negotiated deal on reforms that will guarantee Catalonia’s uniqueness\nHave there been any significant changes since then? Yes, there have. More than a few mistakes by everyone involved have altered the situation notably. Realities have changed and so have perceptions, which are often guided by feelings rather than reason.\nI have always said that we made a mistake with the new regional charter, the <em>Estatuto</em>. We didn’t do a good job here in Catalonia. It was a mistake to do it in agreement with just one part of Spain. The Socialist Party made a mistake, too. But we had already made a serious mistake before that, by securing support for former Catalan premier Jordi Pujol’s last term in office from the Popular Party (PP), when the latter had an absolute majority in Congress.\nThe worst mistake of all, however, is attributable to the PP and its campaign against the Catalan charter. A series of errors climaxed with a ruling by the Constitutional Court, where a comedic situation ensued in which the renewal of sitting justices was blocked by political action. In Catalonia, what remains of all that in the collective imagination is the text of the ruling, which most people have not read, but which is held up as evidence of the region’s exclusion and the breakup of the constitutional framework.\nFrom this viewpoint, there is some sense to the dialectical question of who abandoned whom: did the Constitution abandon Catalonia or did Catalonia abandon the Constitution? This feeling has been reinforced over the last four years by laws such as <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2012/12/04/inenglish/1354623092_139510.html\">the one drafted by former education minister José Ignacio Wert</a>, by recentralizing processes, by discrimination in investment, and by an unfair financing system.\nMost recently, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/09/01/inenglish/1441105513_308576.html\">the fast-track reform</a> awarding the Constitutional Court the ability to dole out sanctions is not going to resolve the underlying problem. It deeply pains those of us who defend dialogue to hear the PP candidate say that “the joke is over.” My God, we’re not in a Wild West saloon waiting to see who shouts the loudest!\nThat is why I cannot remain unmoved when I see praise of González’s article expressed by those who practice the kind of intransigent politics that his article attacks, and who rush to the courts with appeals as though ignorant of the fact that piling up the court rulings is not an effective way of doing politics.\nIn his letter-article, the former prime minister warns about the risks and costs of independence. It is advisable to stress – contrary to those who use unity and secession in a partisan way, only recognizing drawbacks for the opponent – that independence is negative for everyone. Is it bad for Catalonia? Yes. For Spain? Also, of course! And even for the European Union!\nDid the Constitution abandon Catalonia or did Catalonia abandon the Constitution?\nI have spent the last three years seeking the Spanish prime minister’s attention in Congress, warning that the day would come when we would see a unilateral declaration of independence. Such a move will have no legal effects at the European and international level, but it will certainly have economic and social effects for everyone involved. Or does a rising risk premium affect Catalans alone? All Spaniards should demand dialogue from their elected officials, which is what Felipe González means when he talks about mutual understanding.\nJust a few months back, pro-independence campaigners applauded a declaration on Catalonia made by the Danish parliament. All this body said was that the governments of Catalonia and the Spanish state should talk democratically and reach an agreement. And that is the only way forward: a negotiated deal on reforms that will guarantee Catalonia’s uniqueness.\nFelipe González does not believe in the breakup of Spain. I don’t believe Catalonia will break away either. But I am worried about the split within either one, and between both. We need a critical mass that will push into insignificance those in Spain who irresponsibly ask for Catalans to leave once and for all, and those in Catalonia who look at everyone else with contempt.\nAll Spaniards should demand dialogue from their elected officials\nThe breakup of the moderate catalanism once represented by Convergencia i Unió is bad news for all of Spain. That is why some of us are rowing against the tide in a bid to reduce the effects as much as possible.\nUnfortunately, pitting Catalonia against Spain and vice versa is a good way of getting votes. I only see one way forward, and that is overcoming the ignorance that fuels this debate. Ignorance is not about not knowing things: the kind of ignorance that brings in the votes involves refusing to know things. And it is up to Felipe González and all Spaniards to put an end to it.\n<strong>Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida</strong> is the leader of the Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) party, a member of Congress and a former official in the Catalan government\nTranslation by <a href=\"http://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a/\">Susana Urra</a>."

            "contentBody": "Former Spanish prime minister Felipe González could have spoken louder, but his message could not have been clearer. “When you confront a dictatorship, you know what to expect, but not when you confront a betrayed democracy,” the ex-Socialist Party leader said on Thursday during a news conference in Madrid to talk about his visit to Caracas. “Venezuela is the kingdom of arbitrariness and President Maduro is taking the country towards destruction.”\nGonzález <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/08/inenglish/1433757494_584854.html\">traveled to the Latin American country last Sunday</a> to advise the defense teams of incarcerated opposition leaders <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/18/inenglish/1424272014_489473.html\">Leopoldo López</a> and <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/20/inenglish/1424427442_337332.html\">Antonio Ledezma</a>. López has started a hunger strike, while Ledezma is under house arrest after undergoing surgery.\nVenezuela is a destroyed country in every way, from an economic standpoint and from a security standpoint”\nGonzález underlined that the situation in Venezuela was “unsustainable” and that there was “a growing concern throughout Latin America over what is happening. Everyone is worried, except Maduro.” \nHe continued: “Venezuela is a destroyed country in every way, from an economic standpoint and from a security standpoint. Maduro is the one responsible for this catastrophe in terms of the social and economic crises and [lack of] basic human rights, and there is no willingness for dialogue within the government.\n“I have come back very sad and worried. I am worried that such a rich country is walking toward a process of destruction,” he added.\nAccording to the ex-prime minister, the Latin American nation “needs dialogue and reconciliation and for that it needs to restore democracy,” González said. “We have to go to Eastern Europe to find something similar to what I have seen in Venezuela.”\nStill, González said he had achieved all the objectives of the visit. “I saw the imprisoned leaders’ families, Antonio Ledezma, [opposition leader] Henrique Capriles, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/05/07/inenglish/1430990235_273723.html\">the winner of the Ortega y Gasset prize, Teodoro Petkoff</a>. I met with students. I had a lot of security and I would even say it was more than I needed.”\nGonzález’s presence at the press conference, which was held to introduce the Association of Venezuelan Journalists in Spain, turned it into quite an event. Miguel Enrique Otero, the editor and owner of Venezuelan opposition newspaper <em>El Nacional</em>, also attended.\nThe former prime minister began his remarks by thanking the Venezuelan president for making his visit newsworthy. “Maduro’s clumsiness gave the trip a great deal of impact,” he said.\nHe also thanked Otero for his work. The Venezuelan government’s number two, Diosdado Cabello, has reported the journalist for reprinting news stories from foreign media outlets about<a href=\"launched%20into%20him%20and%20other%20Venezuelan%20politicians\"> the investigation </a><a href=\"launched%20into%20him%20and%20other%20Venezuelan%20politicians\">the United States</a><a href=\"launched%20into%20him%20and%20other%20Venezuelan%20politicians\"> has launched into him and other Venezuelan officials</a> for alleged drug trafficking and money laundering. “It’s the only free press newspaper printed in Venezuela nowadays,” González said.\nAsked why he had left the South American country on Tuesday, less than 48 hours after his arrival, without being granted permission to visit López in the Ramo Verde military prison or attend his court hearing on Wednesday, the ex-prime minister said: “Why should I go running out of that paradise of freedom that is Venezuela?”\nMaduro’s clumsiness gave the trip a great deal of impact”\nRegarding why <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/10/inenglish/1433928365_829064.html\">he had used a Colombian air force plane</a> to leave the country, González said that he had been able to take advantage of President Juan Manuel Santos’s official plane to travel to the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) conference in Brussels along with him.\nIn spite of all the roadblocks and obstacles, González said he had come back with the hope that Venezuela would soon hold parliamentary elections, and that he had called on the international community for help. He said that all of Latin America – “whether they say so or not” – was concerned. “Even the Castros see the regime as a hindrance,” González said. He also admitted that he was personally “hurt” to see the situation in which the families of political prisoners find themselves.\nTranslation: Dyane Jean François"

If I can go, I will go, and if I can’t, I’ll postpone it, or travel at a different time,” González said in Washington on Thursday evening.\nThe longest-serving prime minister in Spanish democratic history (1982-1996), González has remained active in global politics and traveled to Washington to participate in the 2015 Democracy Award, which was given to López and Ledezma by the National Endowment for Democracy.\n I think that genetically I am better prepared to handle a struggle against a dictatorship than to handle the loss of a democracy set to become a dictatorship”\nFelipe González\nThe awards were accepted by the wives of the two political prisoners, Lilian Tintori and Mitzy Capriles.\nGonzález, who is a lawyer by trade, has already been warned by the Venezuelan government that “he is not considered welcome” and that it would “not provide any support” if he chooses to fly there.\nThe Nicolás Maduro administration warned that any actions undertaken by González in Caracas would “fall under his complete responsibility,” news agency Efe reports.\nIn a press statement, González also revealed that López’s court hearing, which he was planning to attend next week, has been postponed to June, a fact that could alter his plans.\nPresident Nicolás Maduro says González is not welcome in Venezuela.\nIn mid-April, the Venezuelan National Assembly <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/22/inenglish/1429695641_829880.html\">declared González “persona non grata</a>,” banning him from entering the country because of his public support for political prisoners. The decision, however, is not binding.\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has also accused González – as well as current Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy – of being part of an international conspiracy to overthrow his government.\n“I have not asked authorities for their support,” said González, adding that he is offering to help López and Ledezma “out of personal conviction and principles.”\n“I spent half of my own life in a dictatorship, and the other half in a democracy. I think that genetically I am better prepared to handle a struggle against a dictatorship than to handle the loss of a democracy set to become a dictatorship,” he said at the awards ceremony.\n“The government of Venezuela can prevent me from participating in their defense within Venezuela, but it cannot prevent me from participating in their defense altogether,” he added. “The world of liberties, of democracy and of human rights goes far beyond the Venezuelan borders, and Venezuela is bound to them.”\nOn March 23, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/23/inenglish/1427119675_424708.html\" target=\"_blank\">González told EL PAÍS</a> that he would defend opposition leaders <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/18/inenglish/1424272014_489473.html\" target=\"_blank\">Leopoldo López</a> and Caracas Mayor <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/20/inenglish/1424427442_337332.html\" target=\"_blank\">Antonio Ledezma</a>, who are both being held in a military prison outside Caracas, because he was concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in the Latin American country.\nLópez, 42, is on trial after he was <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/18/inenglish/1392750497_342311.html\" target=\"_blank\">jailed in February 2014</a> on conspiracy and sedition charges in connection with violent <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/13/inenglish/1392294607_787167.html\" target=\"_blank\">anti-government protests</a>, in which more than 40 people were killed across Venezuela.\nLedezma, a top leader of the Democratic Action (AD) party, was arrested in February after he signed a public petition calling for Maduro’s resignation and new elections."

            "contentBody": "At a time when Spanish politics has already witnessed several unusual events – including <a href=\"http://elpais.com/agr/spanish_elections/a\">a repeat general election</a> and more than six months of a caretaker government – former Socialist statesman Felipe González is raising eyebrows by asking his party not to obstruct a government by the Popular Party (PP).\nEven as the Socialist Party (PSOE) insists on denying congressional support for the reinstatement of acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, González, who was Spain’s longest-serving prime minister (1982-1996), is insisting on the need to form a government as soon as possible “after losing eight months in a strange interim situation.”\nIn an opinion piece published Thursday in EL PAÍS, González said that Rajoy must take the initiative and seek support from other parties, while the Socialists should listen, talk and, “in case of need,” not obstruct a PP government.\nSocialists say no for now\nThe Socialist Party, which is holding a meeting of its federal committee on Saturday, said it respects González’s opinion but is not planning to go down that road for now.\n“The PP leader cannot hope to govern with 137 seats aided by abstention,” said Óscar López, the Socialist spokesman in the Senate. And Andalusian premier Susana Díaz said that the Socialists cannot be “accomplices to the pain and suffering” caused by Rajoy’s policies since he won the 2011 election.\nBut some regional party leaders are not closing the door to reviewing this position if there is a new situation of gridlock in Congress.\n“It is beyond imagination to have a repeat situation of what we experienced after December 20, much less now that the PP obtained 14 additional deputies and that an alternative is just about impossible,” he wrote, alluding to the failure of cross-party negotiations following the inconclusive first election.\nIf parties fail to reach deals once again, Spain could be facing a third election.\n“Citizens will understand that, at this point in my life, I am reaffirmed in giving priority to the general interests of Spain and its citizens above anything else,” said González, 74. “The Socialist Party cannot and must not enter into a coalition with the PP. It must occupy its position responsibly in the opposition. But political forces have a responsibility: if they cannot form a government themselves, they cannot obstruct another government from being formed.”\nAlso on Thursday, acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called González’s opinion on the issue “very qualified” and agreed on the need to avoid a third election. “Citizens are sick and tired,” he said.\nHe also agreed with González that an executive must be formed “as speedily as possible.”\n“There is no call for wasting all summer,” he told reporters in Congress. “I don’t know what we could fix in August that we cannot fix in July.”\nThe caretaker prime minister noted that no bills have been sent to parliament since September 2015, when the original election campaign began\nHis words suggested that he is planning to stand for a reinstatement vote on the last week of July. Justice Minister Rafael Catalá has also said that the investiture debate could be held the last week of July, after the new congressional term of office begins.\nRajoy is pressuring for the investiture debate to be held as soon as possible, citing the need for Congress and the Senate to approve the spending ceiling – a necessary step prior to getting the 2017 budget passed. He has also invoked the need to start making decisions in connection with the EU, including potential sanctions for overshooting the deficit target, and the recent <a href=\"http://elpais.com/agr/brexit/a/\">Brexit vote</a>.\nThe caretaker prime minister noted that no bills have been sent to parliament since September 2015, when the original election campaign began.\nBut Rajoy did not disclose whether he knows what the Socialists’ position will be at the investiture vote.\n“[Socialist leader] Pedro Sánchez has not told me his opinion, and if there was one, whether it is definitive or not,” he said.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"http://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a/\">Susana Urra</a>."

He also hinted that he might return to the political fray.\nSpeaking in Paris where he was attending a seminar on Tuesday, González declined to confirm a report by Spanish daily Abc of the meeting with Rajoy. However, the prime minister’s office later confirmed the encounter had taken place. “It’s not up to me to confirm this meeting, but I will say that whatever the color of the political banner, I am open to helping out,” said González, who is Spain’s longest-serving prime minister since the restoration of democracy.\nGonzález responded in a jocund tone to the idea of the possible return of Aznar to the political arena. “If he wants to come back then let him come back. If he believes he needs to come back, then let him. However, what I feel uncomfortable about is that he feels obliged to come back to save the country.”\n“I won’t comment on Aznar’s attitude,” González continued. “You can disagree with the government, and I disagree with a lot of policies in Spain and Europe. But you can also be willing to cooperate and help out with what the country needs.”\nIn further reference to Aznar, González said : “I put forward the idea of a large Chinese vase in a small apartment,” the former Socialist leader said. “You can attribute value to it, but it gets in the way.”"

What’s more, Maduro himself warned the Socialist politician against meddling in domestic affairs. Via his Twitter account, the Venezuelan leader wrote this weekend: “The Bogota-Madrid-Miami connection is acting with desperation by sending over personalities to legitimize its war against Venezuela. They want to mess with the homeland.”\nLópez and jailed San Cristóbal mayor <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/03/27/inenglish/1427452320_478256.html\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Ceballos</a>, who are both on hunger strike at the prisons where they are being held, were charged in connection to the February 2014 anti-government protests, at which at least 40 people died and many more were injured.\nOn Monday, the former prime minister met with members of  MUD, a coalition of opposition parties\nCeballos was specifically <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/03/20/inenglish/1395327234_224524.html\">accused of not following government orders</a> to remove protestors’ barricades, which were set up in the streets of San Cristóbal, a city in Venezuela’s southwestern Táchira state, near the Colombian border.\nAfter several frustrated attempts to make the journey, González finally arrived in Caracas on Sunday, and headed directly to the López family residence, where he met with family members and lawyers for the now-jailed former mayor of the Caracas suburb of Chacao.\nAfter the meeting he told reporters that “Venezuela needed a lot of dialogue,” adding that he thought it was a “good gesture” on President Nicolás Maduro’s part to hold regional and parliamentary elections in the country this year.\nOn Monday, the former prime minister met with members of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), a coalition of opposition parties, with the aim of analyzing the political situation in Venezuela ahead of possible elections later this year.\nAfter his meeting with MUD, González went to the home of TalCual editor Teodoro Petkoff to deliver the Ortega y Gasset Journalism Prize awarded to him last month by EL PAÍS. The 83-year-old former Marxist guerrilla has been prohibited from leaving the country after several government officials filed defamation and libel suits against him for his news coverage."

Six people were injured as a result.\nAmedo told the High Court that a police commander \"would never have ordered criminal attacks.\" Amedo also pointed the finger at the then-interior minister, José Barrionuevo, as also being behind GAL, which he claimed had the tacit support of Basque Socialist barons Txiki Benegas and Ramón Jáuregui.\nIn an interview in EL PAÍS published in November of last year, González, who headed the government from 1982 to 1996, said he once had the chance to give the order to kill the entire ETA leadership, prompting the opposition Popular Party to claim he had identified himself as the \"Mr X of GAL.\"\nPlanchuelo, who was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail in 1998 for taking part in the kidnapping by GAL of Basque businessmen Segundo Marey, who was mistaken for a member of ETA, on Monday denied he had funded the hiring of the Portuguese hitmen to carry out the attacks in the Batxoki and La Consolation bars in 1986 in the French Basque Country. He said he found out about the attacks from the media, and also claimed to be unaware that Amedo had traveled to Lisbon with another policeman to hire the mercenaries."

The Spanish Socialist was able to hold a brief meeting with Ledezma, who is under house arrest while he recovers from surgery for a hernia.\nGonzález <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/08/inenglish/1433757494_584854.html\" target=\"_blank\">publicly called for dialogue</a> between the opposition and the Maduro government.\n“In the eyes of all Venezuelans, [González] left the so-called opposition, as well as the conservative right wing, in bad shape,” Maduro said.\n“He came over here to support extremist groups who are trying to oust me from power. Really, it is an embarrassing and pitiful situation. Actually, we are indignant.”"

It was best to cancel the event\nAntonio Rovira, law professor\nThe protest was organized by a group that calls itself Libertarian Student Federation, which distributed leaflets insulting both speakers and accusing them of “using their power and political influence to increase inequality.”\nIn recent weeks, both González and Cebrián have been blamed by leaders of the anti-austerity Podemos party, and particularly by its secretary general Pablo Iglesias, for allegedly pressuring the Socialist Party (PSOE) into <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/14/inenglish/1476432668_139586.html\">delivering the executive</a> to the Popular Party (PP) through an abstention at an upcoming investiture vote in Congress.\nSome protesters held up a sign sympathizing with ETA convicts.\nSpain has been in deadlock since December 20 of last year, when an inconclusive election yielded a fragmented parliament in which no force was able to secure a large enough majority to form a government. A repeat election on June 26 produced a similar result, with the PP winning the most votes both times.\nSince then, the PSOE <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/10/17/inenglish/1476692114_646593.html\">has been debating</a> whether to keep voting down acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s attempts at reinstatement, or whether to let him form a minority government to take Spain out of its prolonged limbo. Felipe González, Spain’s longest-serving prime minister and a respected figure of Spanish Socialism, has <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/07/07/inenglish/1467902805_231199.html\">come out in support</a> of the latter option.\nAlarmed by the violence\nSeveral masked individuals stationed themselves at the auditorium doors to prevent people from attending the panel discussion, which was part of a series about civil society and global change organized by PRISA.\nA leaflet attacking González and Cebrián was distributed ahead of the scheduled talk.\nThe dean of the law school, Yolanda Valdeolivas, faced the angry group and told them that their attitude was “shameful.”\nAntonio Rovira, a professor of constitutional law at the university, said he was struck by the violence of the protest.\n“This [protest] had been announced, but we thought it would be peaceful,” he said. “But the level of violence acquired traits that went beyond the protest. It was best to cancel the event. There was another option, which was to resort to force and clear the way, but this has to be a very exceptional option at a university.”\n“They are not letting us speak inside the auditorium. We don’t know what to do in this type of situation,” added Rovira. “We are a little lost in the face of these signs of violence. The crowd came from outside this school. Today was a day for talking about things that people are allowed to disagree with. But we are persistent and stubborn, and we will try again.”\nEnglish version by <a href=\"http://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a/\">Susana Urra</a>."

I have recovered the simple status of a citizen, although at all times I have remained committed to our common destiny. It is because of this commitment to Spain, the public space we have shared for centuries, that I am addressing the citizens of Catalonia so that they do not allow themselves to be dragged into an illegal and irresponsible venture that endangers coexistence among Catalans and between Catalans and other Spaniards.\nI have always been thankful for Catalans' constant and majority support during my time in government, even when that support was declining in the rest of Spain. And thanks to that understanding I have always been able to represent you with pride, as I have all other Spaniards, in Europe, in Latin America, and around the world. With your trust we have moved forward together over many years, overcoming the heavy legacy of the dictatorship, consolidating freedoms, establishing the bases of the welfare state and recognizing, like never before in history, the identity of Catalonia and its right to self-government.\nI have believed, and go on believing that we are much better together than opposed: recognizing diversity as a shared asset and not as a cause for rupture between us. For me, Spain would no longer be Spain without Catalonia and neither would Catalonia be what it is separated and isolated.\nThe idea of “breaking away” from Spain, as Catalan regional premier Artur Mas proposes, in a strange and ridiculous front rejecting and breaking the law, would have a number of consequences of which everyone should be aware:\nI have believed, and go on believing that we are much better together than opposed\n— They would be breaking away from a substantial part of Catalan society, fracturing it dramatically. This is already being felt, and voices rejecting those who do not have a Catalan “pedigree” are starting to be heard. These Catalan citizens are today concerned that their freedom to express their opposition to this venture is being limited, because their identity as both Catalan and Spanish, which they see as an asset rather than a contradiction, is being denied to them or restricted.\n— They would be breaking away from the rest of Spain, breaking away from the Constitution and thus also the statute that guarantees them self-government and the secular coexistence that we share in this public space. On the verge of madness, they have started <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/25/inenglish/1440498904_546028.html?rel=rosEP\">to offer Catalan citizenship</a> to those in Aragon, Valencia, the Balearics, and southern France. We have gone through periods when differences, feelings of belonging, and language have been repressed, but the last four decades have seen us enter a new stage of recognizing diversity and the construction of the most complete form of self-government there has ever been in Catalonia.\n— They would be <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/08/27/inenglish/1440673122_613069.html\">breaking away from Europe</a>, isolating Catalonia in a venture that has no purpose or advantage for anyone. Can you imagine a European Council made up of 150 or 200 members in a union that is already difficult to govern? Because that would be the result of breaking down the structure of the 28 states that make up the EU. Can you imagine France handing over part of its territory to satisfy the demands of this new irredentism? Nobody serious would go along with that in Europe, particularly not in Spain, which has fought so much to become part of and participate in the European project, such as it is, with its diversity, and —  incidentally — with the utmost support of Catalonia.\nHow can they want to take the Catalan people into isolation, into a kind of 21st-century version of what Albania once was?\n— They would be breaking away from Ibero-America, a link that has so much value and importance for everyone, especially in Catalonia, because it is a connection made through Spain as a nation state and the language we share with 500 million people — Castilian Spanish — something of which the major publishers in this language, who are in Barcelona, are well aware.\nNaturally they say the opposite: “We only want to break away from Spain.” From what Spain? The one that also includes Aragon, Valencia and the Balearics? Those responsible for the proposal know what I am telling them is the truth. In reality they are trying to take you citizens of Catalonia to the real “dead end” of which Mas once spoke in a strange Freudian slip.\nWe live in the most connected society in history. The technological revolution means “connection,” and “interconnection” — the complete opposite of a “disconnection” or breaking away. The interdependence between us grows greater by the day: between Spaniards of all identities, Europeans of the union of 28 nation states, Latin Americans of over 20 countries, not to mention our neighbors to the south and in the rest of the world. This is the disconnection they are asking for from their companies, the ones that create wealth and employment.\nRegardless of the result of the election, the proposal being made by Junts pel sí (Together for yes), <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/21/inenglish/1437471078_289683.html\">this strange coalition united only by its rejection of Spain</a>, could be the start of a real “dead end” for Catalonia. How can they want to take the Catalan people into isolation, into a kind of 21st-century version of what Albania once was? Mas is tricking the supporters of independence and those who believed that the right to decide about the public space we share as a nation state could be arbitrarily and illegally broken up, or that that was the way to negotiate most forcefully. He is making the same mistake that former prime minister Alexis Tsipras made in Greece, but outside of the law and with more serious results.\nBy breaking the law, they will not manage to seat anyone round a negotiating table who has the duty to respect and uphold it\nWhat happened after Tsipras proposed to the Greeks a referendum in order to reject the European Union’s offer and thus “negotiate with more strength”? After more than 60 percent of Greeks believed him, Tsipras ended up accepting much worse conditions than the ones rejected in the referendum, arguing that they knew in advance, that there was no other way out. They knew that there was no other way out, and they tricked the citizens?\nBy breaking the law, they will not manage to seat anyone round a negotiating table who has the duty to respect and uphold it. No official can permit a done-deal policy, and less by breaking the law, because it would invite others to embark on ventures in the opposing direction. We would all be risking what has already been achieved, and the possibility of moving forward through dialogue and reforms.\nThat is what we need: agreed reforms that guarantee the differentiating facts without breaking either basic citizen equality or the sovereignty of everyone to decide our common future. We don’t need more liquidationists in our history proposing to break coexistence and the rules of the game with falsely democratic plans\nIf the reform of the Catalan electoral law has not been able to be passed because the authorized majority laid out in the statute cannot be met, how can they seriously consider the liquidation of the same statute and of the Constitution in which it is legalized, if they obtain one deputy more in that unified election list of rejection? How come the regional premier is in fourth place on the list of candidates, as if he needed a Praetorian Guard in order to break the law?\nThe technological revolution means “interconnection” — the complete opposite of a breaking away\nWhat it most resembles is the German and Italian ventures of the 1930s. But it is hard for us to express it in these terms out of respect for the tradition of coexistence in Catalonia. Mas knows that from the very moment he fails to fulfill his obligation as head of the regional government and as first representative of the state in Catalonia, he is violating his promise to uphold THE LAW. He places himself in a position above the law, no longer representing all Catalans and losing democratic legitimacy in the carrying out of his duties.\nI do not agree with <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/31/inenglish/1438352284_257740.html\">the intransigence of the national government</a>, which is closed to dialogue and reform, nor with its unnecessary appeals to the Constitutional Court. But that conviction, which narrows the margin of manuever for those who would like to move forward along a path of understanding, cannot lead me to take a position halfway between those who abide by the law and those who try to break it.\nI do not believe that Spain is going to break up, because I know that is not going to happen, regardless of the result of the September 27 regional elections in Catalonia. I think that the rift in coexistence this venture causes will affect our future and that of our children and I am trying to contribute to avoiding it. I know that taking the path of confrontation will cost us everything. By taking the path of understanding we can go on advancing and solving our problems."

            "contentBody": "The revelations made by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González in an interview with Juan José Millás, published on Sunday in EL PAÍS, have caused political shockwaves.\nPopular Party (PP) officials claim that the Socialist González, the longest-serving leader in Spain's democratic history, has identified himself as the \"Mr X of GAL\" by admitting that during his 1982-1996 tenure, he once had a chance to give the order to kill the entire leadership of ETA, after unknown sources discovered the exact date and location where the terrorists were going to meet, somewhere on French soil.\nAlthough González said he finally decided against it, the conservative party says that the fact he had this opportunity effectively links him with GAL, a state-funded undercover group created in the 1980s to fight the Basque terrorists using unlawful methods.\n\"The chances we had of arresting them were zero; they were outside our territory\"\n\"If the decision to kill or not to kill in France was made by the prime minister, then we know what he decided once, but not whether he made different decisions on other occasions,\" argued Esteban González Pons, the PP's deputy spokesman. Pons also said that González is admitting that \"the shores of GAL reached as far as the prime minister's table,\" in reference to a group that, according to subsequent investigations, was set up by high-ranking officials in the Interior Ministry under González's tenure.\nOn the other hand, the speaker in Congress, José Bono - like González, a Socialist - said in a television interview that he wonders what \"those who are now tearing out their hair\" over González's statements would have done themselves, had they been given the opportunity to participate in that decision.\n\"Some people's cynicism is sky-high,\" said Bono, who asserted that González will go down in history as the leader who took Spain into the European Union.\nGonzález, 68, has been on the sidelines of power for the last 14 years yet remains visibly present in public life as a speaker at a variety of events. Praised by some as one of Spain's greatest statesmen and derided by others as the visible head of a period marked by a number of high-profile corruption cases involving state secretaries and even ministers (former Interior Minister José Barrionuevo was convicted for his role in the GAL kidnapping of a French-Spanish citizen named Segundo Marey), he has nonetheless been a seminal figure in contemporary Spanish history.\nThe subject of GAL - whose members were tried and convicted many years ago - resurfaced again recently when the newspaper El Mundo reported that Socialist officials, including the newly appointed deputy prime minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, tried to buy tapes of recorded conversations proving the González government's involvement with GAL. Some Socialist leaders believe that the PP is trying to use this information to attack Rubalcaba now that he is the number-two man in government.\nSocialist leaders have denied the Rubalcaba link as \"totally false,\" however.\nGonzález's controversial statements were part of a much larger interview conducted in late September, in which the former leader talked about his personal life and his views on everything from national politics to the global economic crisis.\n\"It's been a long time since I was in power, but I'm going to tell you something that may surprise you,\" he said at one point. \"I still don't even know whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing - I'm not putting a moral problem to you, because I'm not sure myself. I had one chance in my life to give an order to eliminate the entire ETA leadership. Before the fall of Bidart in 1992 [when ETA's leaders were arrested in one operation], they wanted to ruin the Olympic Games and get international coverage... I don't know how long before that, maybe in 1990 or 1989, I received a piece of information that had to reach all the way up to me because of its implications.\n\"This wasn't about ordinary anti-terrorism operations: our people had detected - I won't say who - the place and date of a meeting of ETA leaders in southern France. The entire leadership. It was an operation they'd been following for a long time. The day and place were known, but the chances we had then of arresting them were zero; they were outside our territory. And the possibility of France doing it at that time was very remote.\n\"Now it would be easier. Even if it was our own services that detected it, if ETA's leaders were to meet in a French location France would descend upon them and arrest the whole lot. But not back then. In those days, the only possibility was to blow them all up inside the house where they were going to meet. I won't even begin to tell you what the implications of acting on French territory would have been - I won't explain all the literature, but the bare facts were that there was a possibility to blow them all up and leave [ETA] headless.\n\"The decision was either yes or no. I'll cut to the chase: I said no. And I add: I still don't know whether I did the right thing. I am not suggesting that I would never do it for moral reasons. No, that's not true. One of the things that tortured me during the next 24 hours is how many murders of innocent people I could have saved in the next four or five years. That's the literature. The result is that I said no.\"\nFelipe González\nFormer Prime Minister Felipe González, in a photo taken on the Barcelona-Madrid AVE, in September 2010.\n<a name=\"despiece1\"></a>The GAL's dirty war\nThe Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (or GAL) were the only instance in Spain's democratic history of a state-sponsored \"dirty war\" against ETA. These undercover armed units were created in the 1980s, when the Basque terrorist organization was at the height of its power. The GAL, whose members were often mercenaries, acted against ETA members, although on occasion they targeted individuals with no known relation to the terrorist group.\nActive between 1983 and 1987, they killed 23 people, mostly in the French Basque Country. Three of their most famous victims were Segundo Marey, who was kidnapped in December 1983 and released 10 days later when it became evident he was the wrong man, and ETA members José Lasa Arostegui and José Ignacio Zabala, who were murdered. The last GAL-related assassination took place in November 1989, when Josu Muguruza, a deputy with Herri Batasuna (ETA's political branch) was gunned down in Madrid, although GAL's responsibility was never ascertained.\nEleven people were eventually convicted by the Supreme Court for their role in creating or assisting GAL, including then-Interior Minister José Barrionuevo, state secretary for security Rafael Vera, the Socialist Party's secretary general in Vizcaya, Ricardo García Damborenea, Civil Guard General Enrique Rodríguez Galindo and police deputy commissioner José Amedo. Some media outlets posited that an unknown individual, the so-called Mr X, must have been the real head of GAL."

His comments were received with applause by the guests at the ceremony, which was held at a hotel in the US capital.\n“When the rules of the game are not respected, power is used arbitrarily,” he said.\nSince he left the prime minister’s office, 73-year-old González has been very active in Latin American issues, and has made frequent trips to the region. In the past months, he has been actively involved in the Venezuelan political crisis.\nIn June, he traveled to Caracas to participate in the legal defense of opposition leaders Leopoldo López and Antonio Ledezma, who serves as mayor of the Venezuelan capital. González was able to meet with Ledezma while the Venezuelan politician was under house arrest recovering from surgery, but he was <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/09/inenglish/1433867807_539352.html\" target=\"_blank\">not allowed to visit López</a> at a military prison outside Caracas.\nGonzález was one of 25 former Iberoamerican leaders who signed a document denouncing the “lack of democratic guarantees” in Venezuela, and calling for “free and fair” elections and the immediate release of all political prisoners.\nAlso signing the document were former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar of the Popular Party (PP); ex-presidents Felipe Calderón and Vicente Fox of Mexico; Belisario Betancur and Álvaro Uribe of Colombia; Sebastián Piñera of Chile; and Julio María Sanguinetti of Uruguay.\n“We all have the obligation to come together and say, ‘stop this now’,” González said on Tuesday night. He called on Maduro to “respect your own citizens, not cause divisions,” and “accept democracy and play by the rules.”\n“When the rules of play are not respected, power is used arbitrarily”\nFormer Prime Minister González\n<a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/09/inenglish/1433841081_278976.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dialogue</a> between the government and opposition was the only solution to the Venezuelan crisis, González said, adding that Maduro should initiate talks after the December 6 parliamentary elections.\nWhile he described Venezuela as a “negative factor” for regional development, he praised the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba and the ongoing peace process in Colombia.\n“There are positive developments in the region, which give me great confidence that problems will be resolved,” he said, adding that he has dedicated 45 of the last 50 years of his life to Latin American issues.\nA broad representation of the political, diplomatic and media sectors in the United States and Latin America attended the awards ceremony, which was sponsored in part by EL PAÍS and its parent group, PRISA.\nAmong the guests were assistant US Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson; former presidents Zedillo of Mexico, Ricardo Lagos of Chile and Sanguinetti of Uruguay; former Inter-American Development Bank president Enrique Iglesias; Spain’s ambassador to Washington, Ramón Gil-Casares; PRISA and EL PAÍS chairman <a href=\"http://www.prisa.com/en/pagina/juan-luis-cebrian/\" target=\"_blank\">Juan Luis Cebrián</a>; and PRISA CEO <a href=\"http://www.prisa.com/en/pagina/consejo-de-administracion/\" target=\"_blank\">José Luis Sainz</a>.\nAn award was also given to Daniel Chávez Morán of Mexico, who is the founder of Vidanta tourism group, for his philanthropy.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martingdelfin\">Martin Delfín</a>."

We have fought a lot in the past, but always within this centrality, and with shared goals for the country” said Aznar, alluding to González and himself. “In Spain, for the last five or six years, no decision has been made on an important matter.”\nThe political situation could seriously harm the economy\nJosé María Aznar, ex-PM of Spain\n“Now we have a five-party system, but there are still two blocks and they seek to antagonize one another: it seems like the one who strays the furthest from the center gets to dominate the scene,” added González.\nTwo men who once clashed often in public – Aznar is still remembered for his phrase “Váyase, señor González” (or Go away, Mr González) while the Socialists made a <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/04/09/inenglish/1554792934_759961.html\">famous campaign video</a> comparing their rival to a doberman – now found themselves agreeing on numerous issues.\n“Common goals have disappeared and the political situation could seriously harm the economy,” said Aznar. González agreed. “It is absolutely true that a prolonged political instability creates mistrust in investors.”\nWithout naming any names, the former PSOE leader recommended that today’s political leaders “go to the thinking corner to decide what to do about Spain, and to think more about <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/07/04/inenglish/1562225341_303951.html\">the general good</a> than the personal one.”\nEnglish version by <a href=\"https://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a\">Susana Urra</a>."

            "contentBody": "Felipe González, who is Spain’s longest-serving prime minister, has stepped into the debate over what the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) should do to break the prolonged impasse that is keeping the country without a fully functional government.\nGonzález, 74, says he feels betrayed by PSOE Secretary General Pedro Sánchez, who allegedly told him that the party would abstain at the second round of an investiture vote in Congress.\nSánchez says the PSOE must decide whether it remains a leftist party or “subordinate to the right”\nSuch a move would have allowed the interim PM, Mariano Rajoy of the Popular Party (PP), to be reinstated and form a minority government following the repeat elections of June 26.\nInstead, the PSOE voted “no” in both rounds of the investiture session, which was held <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/09/02/inenglish/1472820231_538586.html\">in early September</a>.\n“Naturally I feel deceived and let down by Pedro Sánchez,” said González. “I spoke to him after the June 26 elections, and on June 29 he explained to me that he would go into the opposition and would not try to form an alternative government. […] I really feel tricked because he said they would do one thing, and then it turned out to be another.”\nPLENO DEL CONGRESO\nPSOE leader Pedro Sánchez (l) is under pressure from all sides.\nThe man who brought Spain into the fold of the European Union – then known as the European Economic Community – had <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/07/07/inenglish/1467902805_231199.html\">already expressed</a> his view in early July that the PSOE should not obstruct a PP government in the name of the greater good.\nOn Wednesday morning, González reiterated his position in a radio interview on SER station.\n“The PSOE must abstain; I feel this way more strongly than ever today,” he said.\nResignation of the board?\nGonzález’s views are the latest expression of growing internal exasperation with a party leader who refuses to change his stance – on Monday, Sánchez said he would rather see third elections than help Rajoy into office – but who has no alternative government to offer Spain.\nInstead, Sánchez now wants to put his own leadership to the test by calling primaries on October 23 and asking PSOE members to validate his position. But this move needs to be green-lighted by the federal committee first, and it is unclear whether it will do so.\nIf 18 members out of 35 who sit on the executive board were to walk out, Sánchez would have to go\nThe internal confrontation has escalated to such a point that half the members of the executive board are now considering handing in their resignations to force Sánchez out and cancel his plans for primaries and a party conference.\nIf 18 members out of the 35 who sit on the executive board were to walk out, Sánchez would have to go. As of Tuesday evening, 15 of them said they were willing to take this unprecedented step. “It is a tough and dramatic decision,” said one member of the board.\nIn the meantime, critics are also trying to influence the 290 members of the federal committee before it meets this Saturday, to convince them to shoot down Sánchez’s plans for primaries and a conference.\nSánchez says the primaries and conference are necessary to decide whether the PSOE remains a leftist party or “subordinate to the right.”\nWhile its gets its internal affairs in order, the PSOE is unlikely to engage in further talks with other parties to try to avoid third elections in Spain. And with other political leaders stuck in their respective positions, Spaniards are becoming increasingly resigned to the fact that they will probably be asked to go to the polls again on Christmas Day.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"http://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a/\">Susana Urra</a>."

            "contentBody": "With two weeks to go before deputies meet to vote on the investiture of the next prime minister of Spain, Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez has yet to secure a strong enough alliance to ensure that his bid will be successful.\nIf he fails in his attempt to form a government, as he was <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/02/03/inenglish/1454480270_316515.html\">tasked to do</a> following the general election of December 20, Spain will be forced to hold fresh elections this year.\nBut even that would yield a similar situation of political fragmentation, warn the experts.\n“If there are new elections, we will go through the same situation we are experiencing now,” said former Spanish leader Felipe González on Wednesday.\nGonzález, a Socialist like Sánchez, also sent out a message to Popular Party (PP) leader Mariano Rajoy, who formally won the election with 123 seats but fell short of a congressional majority and has been unable to muster enough backing for a reinstatement bid.\nThe man who governed the country between 1982 and 1996 also issued a warning against the anti-austerity party Podemos, although he did not mention it by name\nRajoy should not place obstacles in Sánchez’s way if the latter finally manages to close a deal with other parties and form a government, said González at a Madrid conference about the future of Spain.\nThe man who governed the country between 1982 and 1996 and oversaw milestones such as Spain’s membership in the European Economic Community and NATO, also issued a warning against the anti-austerity party Podemos, although he did not mention it by name.\n“Left-wing populism wants to replace representative democracy with direct democracy. It encourages regressive utopias. It has the same basis as [French far-right leader] Marine Le Pen,” said González.\nAcross-the-board condemnation\nPodemos, which is trying to convince the Socialists to create a <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453462772_074425.html\">joint coalition government</a>, scandalized politicians and legal experts this week with a working document that proposed assigning key positions in the judiciary based not just on merit, but also on “their commitment to the government’s program.”\nThese positions would include the Attorney General, the justices who sit on the Constitutional Court, and the members of the oversight body, the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ).\nREUNIÓN PODEMOS CONGRESO\nPodemos leader Pablo Iglesias (left) scandalized the legal profession this week with his demand for loyalty to the government.\nThis is the first time that loyalty to the government is expressly stated as a requirement for appointing top legal positions, and legal associations of all kinds have called it an attack against their independence.\n“This is one of the greatest aberrations I have heard in recent times,” said Emilio Frías, spokesman for the conservative prosecutor association Asociación de Fiscales.\nThe Socialist spokesman in the Senate, Óscar López, said on Wednesday that Podemos is proposing “a democratic involution” because of its “obsession” with taking “control” of the secret services (Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has stated his desire to oversee the National Intelligence Center), the police, the judges, the prosecutors and the public broadcaster.\nLópez also criticized Iglesias for telling the Socialist leader to stop being “arrogant.”\n“Pablo Iglesias and humbleness are an oxymoron,” said López. Iglesias has stated that in this joint coalition government, he wants to be the deputy prime minister.\nThe Ciudadanos connection\nMeanwhile, the Socialists are <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/02/04/inenglish/1454598353_574026.html\">deep in talks</a> with the other emerging party to perform well at the election, Ciudadanos, in a bid to secure its support <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/02/15/inenglish/1455531959_507383.html\">on March 2 and 3</a>.\nBut so far the pro-market party, which has 40 seats in Congress, is promising no more than an abstention at the investiture session, which would not be enough for a congressional majority and require support from third parties.\nCiudadanos also says it will not join any government led by either the PP or the Socialist Party, but remain in the opposition.\n“We are working toward a complete agreement, which we still don’t have,” said party spokesman José Manuel Villegas. “The party line is that we will either vote against [Pedro Sánchez] or we will abstain.”\nBoth parties already agree on several major issues, such as lifting parliamentary immunity for deputies under official investigation for corruption, and keeping such individuals off election lists. They also want to encode housing, electricity, water supply and healthcare into the Constitution, as fundamental rights that every citizen is entitled to.\nBut there are still sticking points over tax and labor reform, and over Ciudadanos’ desire to eliminate provincial authorities in order to streamline government.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"http://elpais.com/autor/susana_urra/a/\">Susana Urra</a>."

            "contentBody": "It’s been 20 years since Felipe González walked out of the Spanish prime minister’s office, and 19 since he stopped heading the Socialist Party (PSOE). Yet his influence on the party and on society has only grown in all this time, especially now that the country is in the grip of a political crisis of unpredictable consequences and with no easy solutions.\nIn an interview with EL PAÍS, González explains his point of view on the current situation, and offers a framework for finding a way out of the political impasse.\nThe former head of government holds that the country’s two main forces, the Popular Party (PP) and the PSOE, should set aside concerns over their own future and put Spain’s interests first.\nGonzález says that acting prime minister <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453452177_608496.html\">Mariano Rajoy’s decision not to stand for office at the upcoming investiture session</a> due to lack of congressional support, yet preventing another party leader from doing so, is “irresponsible.”\n“For some time now, the system born out of the Transition and the 1978 Constitution has been showing signs of wear”\nHe also warns about the <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/25/inenglish/1453707903_657887.html\">risks of an alliance between the Socialists and Podemos</a>, a party that he says is trying to “liquidate our democratic framework of coexistence, and while they’re at it, liquidate the Socialists as well.”\nWhile he does not defend any specific party combination, he would rather see a progressive government with a reform program, although he sees this as a difficult option because there is no such majority in parliament right now. In any case, he believes that neither the PP nor the PSOE should prevent the other from forming a government if they themselves cannot.\n<strong>Question.</strong> Do you feel that the current crisis could be proof that Spain’s political system is in crisis?\n<strong>Answer.</strong> For some time now, the system born out of the Transition and the 1978 Constitution has been showing signs of wear. After more than three decades that can only be described as a historical success for Spain, the system needs reform and regeneration. But existing attitudes based on either doing nothing or on liquidating the entire system are giving us very little leeway for the kinds of reforms that are increasingly necessary.\n“There is a very strong rejection of Rajoy, who is refusing to accept his responsibility as head of the PP and of government”\nThe financial crisis and its terrible economic and social consequences have fueled the feeling that change is required. Many citizens feel that certain rights that they feel entitled to, in health and education for instance, are now endangered. People have also suffered from unemployment, wage devaluation, job instability and the ensuing loss of dignity in work. And now that a fragile recovery is underway, citizens see that inequality is not being corrected. And the weariness is growing apace with <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/27/inenglish/1453884424_985650.html\">the constant trickle of corruption cases</a>.\nSo we are effectively experiencing something like the end of a cycle, but without seeing a reform project that is essential to Spain. In the 1980s we knew where we were and what we wanted to be, but like at other times in our own history, it seems like we’ve gone off course and no longer know where we are headed or who we are. Spain is lacking a reform project.\n<strong>Q.</strong> So why did the PP win the most votes?\n<strong>A.</strong> The right-wing vote is more concentrated around the PP than the left-wing vote is around a single party. But the really relevant fact is that the PP has been unable to interpret the outcome for what it really is: a defeat. Not just because they lost nearly 60 deputies, but because they are being rejected by all other parties.\nThere is a very strong rejection of Rajoy, who is refusing to accept his responsibility as head of the PP and of government. There is an equally strong rejection of Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias over his policy of liquidation. But neither one wants to see it that way.\n<strong>Q.</strong> What about the Socialists? Has the PSOE properly interpreted the election outcome?\n<strong>A.</strong> That erroneous reading also affects the Socialist Party, which was clearly defeated at the polls.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Is there a progressive majority in this parliament?\n<strong>A.</strong> I wish there were, because that would be my preferred option for Spain. But I don’t think there is. That does not mean there is a conservative majority, either. Thus our current difficulties.\n<strong>Q.</strong> So who should try to form a government?\n<strong>A.</strong> The logical thing would be for the minority with the greatest representation to try, and that is the PP. But Rajoy’s decision not to bid for reinstatement yet refusing to step aside is so irresponsible that it is hard to put a name to it. What is he trying to do? See others crash and burn and then offer himself as the only solution? Is he thinking only of himself, without thinking of Spain’s interests?\nFELIPE GONZÁLEZ SE REÚNE EN CARACAS CON LA ALIANZA OPOSITORA MUD\nFelipe González with Venezuelan opposition member Lilian Tintori in Caracas in June.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Do you believe that a government where the only thing in common is being anti-PP is legitimate?\n<strong>A.</strong> I don’t like “anti” governments, whatever they are against, although I have lived through them myself. Remember the “Go Away, Mr González” campaign? Governments should be there to carry out policies, not to negate those of others.\nBut it’s not a problem of legitimacy, as you say. It’s obvious that the reforms Spain needs will require the support of the PP in many cases, because that is the reality of our parliament. At the same time, it seems logical to call on the PP to say what it is prepared to do out of conviction, and as such, it is logical to expect it to act accordingly, whether it is in government or in the opposition.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Are you in favor of a grand coalition between the <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/26/inenglish/1453797999_367861.html\">PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos</a>?\n<strong>A.</strong> Absolutely not. It looks to me like a proposal born out of failure, and it will not ensure the governability of Spain in the medium term. The failure stems from a strategy that some call the “government of the Ibex,” a PP-Ciudadanos alliance that creates a squeeze effect against the Socialist Party by supporting the rise of Podemos. Do you remember Rajoy on December 6 encouraging Iglesias? “You’re doing well, Pablo, you’re doing well,” he said to him.\nBut that failed, and they moved on to the slogan “Let's save Private Sánchez,” which was designed to sink the candidate by making <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453473754_068135.html\">[Socialist leader Pedro] Sánchez</a> responsible for the stability that they were defending.\nTo top it off, handing the opposition space to Podemos is a really stupid move, rather than just a mistake, which is generated by their lack of vision for Spain in the medium term. Look, if they don’t carry out the reforms that we need, including democratic regeneration in the face of the rampant corruption that confronts us every day, we are helping feed those who want to liquidate the democratic framework that we currently enjoy.\n“This is a moment more of short-term, opportunistic sidesteps, or of personal survival as in Rajoy’s case, than of long-term visions that would provide answers to the challenges facing Spain”\n<strong>Q.</strong> What, then, would be the best government possible?\n<strong>A.</strong> That’s a lot to ask in an interview like this one, but I believe the time has come to consider our citizens and drop <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453462772_074425.html\">the kind of card-sharp strategies we saw last Friday</a>. No one will be surprised to hear that at this stage in my life, I would rather see a government with a program for Spain that has been agreed upon, even if it is not the government that I am the most keen on personally.\nWe can count the number of congressional seats in two ways: as those on the left and the right, or as those who have signed up to a reform project for Spain, an axis with no place for those who want to end that reality or put it at risk.\nIf political parties were talking about government policies rather than parliamentary combinations that are incompatible with government stability, the answer would be less complicated.\nBut this is not the current climate. We are seeing just another moment of short-term, opportunistic sidesteps, or else of personal survival as in Rajoy's case, rather than a moment of long-term vision that would provide answers to the challenges facing Spain.\n“We need to mend the fractures to social cohesion caused by the policies enacted during the crisis”\n<strong>Q.</strong> Any examples of those short-term sidesteps?\n<strong>A.</strong> One example: PP and Ciudadanos have 163 deputies. On the other hand, the PSOE, Podemos and United Left have 161 deputies. This last option would be a kind of tripartite.\nSo the PP could try to form a government, either with Rajoy or another candidate, along with Ciudadanos.\nIt could also be the PSOE, by talking and negotiating with Ciudadanos, and approaching the amalgam of Podemos while underscoring the essential elements required to talk about a government for Spain.\nIn short, we have to understand the new reality that voters want: they are asking for dialogue and agreements. And there could be a repeat situation, except in worse conditions, if the political leaders don’t assume the outcome of the vote and return the responsibility over to citizens in new elections.\n<strong>Q.</strong> And a PSOE government with Ciudadanos? Do you see that as a possibility?\n<strong>A.</strong> Reaching an agreement with Ciudadanos would mean having a basis for the reforms that we need. But if we are talking about a government of reform and progress, we need to have the number of deputies to support it. The PP needs to clarify whether its policies, which are still in the shadows, stem from conviction or from opportunism. Because there will be no important reforms if the PP vetoes everything.\n<strong>Q.</strong> What do you think a progressive project would be at the current time?\n<strong>A.</strong> We need to mend the fractures to social cohesion caused by the policies enacted during the crisis, and we need to do so with criteria based on sustainability, with a view on the moment in which Spain and the world find themselves.\nWe have to return the dignity to people’s jobs, make them less precarious, improve salaries and link pay to productivity. We also need to reconfigure our system of universal healthcare; reach a cross-party pact on education in general and vocational training in particular; and offer real support, not just with words, for research and innovation in order to improve our ability to compete and to create decent jobs.\n“I am worried about Spain being irrelevant in the engine room of the European Union, because the process is one of shared sovereignty, not of handing over sovereignty”\n<strong>Q.</strong> Do you believe that the PSOE should negotiate with the PP?\n<strong>A.</strong> It is indisputable that there should be dialogue with the PP. It’s quite another thing whether there will be a margin or not to agree on things that would facilitate the reforms I just listed. The style of the Rajoy administration has been one of decrees and impositions without any kind of dialogue, and that is what we need to try and get over. In a democracy you have to respect the mandate you have received from voters, and that includes unreserved dialogue.\n<strong>Q.</strong> How important is Europe in the search for a solution to the current crisis in Spain?\n<strong>A.</strong> I am a pro-European who is critical of the errors made by the European Union in the fight against the crisis. I’m seriously concerned about the challenges the EU faces with regard to issues that cannot be avoided: refugees, the British referendum, security risks and more. But I am also very concerned that <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/15/inenglish/1452860729_002642.html\">the subject of the European Union is missing from our own campaigns</a> and from the current debates.\nI am worried about <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/25/inenglish/1453713864_988989.html\">Spain being irrelevant in the engine room of the European Union</a>, because the process is one of shared sovereignty, not of handing over sovereignty so that others can make decisions for us.\nEnglish version by Susana Urra and Simon Hunter."

His lawyers claim he has not been allowed to present any witnesses on his behalf during his closed-door trial.\nLedezma was arrested in February after Maduro accused him of conspiring to overthrow his government.\nBoth men are being held with about 90 <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/03/20/inenglish/1395327234_224524.html\" target=\"_blank\">other arrested members of the opposition</a> at the Ramo Verde military prison outside Caracas.\nGonzález recently met with Ledezma’s wife Mitzy Capriles in Madrid.\nGovernment officials, such as Calixto Ortega, deputy foreign minister for European affairs, have said that González would only be welcomed in Venezuela as long as he “came without plans to interfere.”\nIn any event, Ortega said, the final decision rests with Maduro “who decides foreign policy.”\nThe Venezuelan government has not publicly prohibited González from entering the country but comments made by other officials weigh toward that direction.\nThe previous Chávez government kicked out an HRW official and an ex-Peruvian presidential candidate\nRuling party Deputy Saúl Ortega, who serves as chairman of the foreign relations committee in the National Assembly, suggested that González is hoping to establish a foreign government in Venezuela.\n“If a person wants to come as a proconsul to interfere with a country’s internal affairs, the least the government can do is send him back,” the chairman said.\nIt wouldn’t be the first time Venezuela has expelled a critic. During the government of the President Hugo Chávez, Human Rights Watch (HRW) director José Miguel Vivancos was kicked out of the country.\nA former presidential candidate in Peru, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/04/25/inenglish/1398454986_041963.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lourdes Flores</a> was also ordered to leave after she compared Chávez to the deposed ex-President Alberto Fujimori.\nMaduro government officials have also said that González cannot practice law in Venezuela because he doesn’t hold a local license or is not a member of the Venezuelan Bar Association.\n“He has no authorization to practice law in Venezuela or to meddle in the internal affairs of this country,” said Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez. “So I would recommend that if his other businesses have failed [...] he should look for another way to make a living.”"

The Popular Party won the most seats in Congress at both elections, but failed to find support for acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's investiture.\nWith the Socialists plunged into chaos, a <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/09/27/inenglish/1474963418_796797.html\">third general election</a> – provisionally timetabled for Christmas Day – is looking ever more likely.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simoninmadrid\">Simon Hunter</a>."

            "contentBody": "Politics as governance of the public space we share is trapped between technocratic arrogance and the audacity of ignorance. Between the “brilliant” postgraduates who believe that the complexity of social problems can be resolved with infallible laboratory algorithms; and the dunces, those who don’t know, and don’t even know they don’t know, and who offer arbitrary answers that simplify and distort reality.\nNeither harbor any doubts when they stray into the public space as messengers of the “truth” or the “post-truth.” And although my thoughts today are dedicated to the latter, I am nevertheless worried about the distant arrogance of those supposed wise men who never explain their mistakes, because for them, it is reality that is out of step.\nDunces are, in and of themselves, relatively harmless, and even positive when they are aware of their ignorance and look for help to cover it. <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/01/20/inenglish/1484911522_528712.html\">Dangerous dunces</a> are those with power over others, and as they don’t recognize their ignorance, they disparage the opinion of others. They try to impose their simplifying “post-truth,” they look for enemies to blame for the reality that they invent, although they use some elements of truth and the fear that this always generates.\nHe will obviously cut social spending (on health and other areas), thus breaking the bonds of social cohesion\nTrump’s most dangerous walls are already built and petrified in his head. They are the ones that should cause the most concern in the United States, Mexico, Latin America, the European Union and the rest of the world, because this character is at the helm of the “still” number one power in the world. There was never a project in his head to govern the diversity that makes his country strong, nothing similar to a program of government in his campaign, and less so in his investiture speech: because this gentleman <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/03/01/inenglish/1488368074_627563.html\">only trusts his own psychopathic “instincts”</a> and those who adulate his insulting and deceitful manners.\nIf any world leader had described the American “reality” in the way that Trump did in his acceptance speech, we would have dismissed him as sectarian and a fanatical hater of the United States. It is worth analyzing this “oratory,” worthy of an autocrat who believes himself to be above all institutions, who looks down on his own people, who looks for enemies and scapegoats among those who are not like him, whether they are immigrants, women, or minorities of all types. In this inaugural piece it can be understood what type of walls reside in his head and orient his many presidential decrees and constant tweets.\nWe will have to hope that some of the “appeasers” who affirmed (there are still many) that he wouldn’t do the things he promised during his campaign, or during these weeks of effective exercise of the presidency, are now fully appraised of what he really intends to do. Because he shows an audacious ignorance of the internal and external reality that he is trying to project his power over.\nThe first society that will pay the price of Trump’s mental walls will be America\nIt is also logical to expect that his imitators will grow and multiply, making it harder to exercise democratic representative governance, the only one that protects our liberties, in the places in the world where it exists. And it matters little that these imitators present themselves under the umbrella, more imaginary than real, of left- or right-wing ideologies. What unites them, or brings them together in “packs,” is their etymologically reactionary position in the face of the vertigo produced by the changes brought about by the technological revolution, and the fraudulent way in which they take advantage of understandable fears among sensitive social groups.\nBecause we are living through a transition at the global level, which, as was the case with the industrial revolution, cannot be reversed, which is generating a growing interdependence, and which is questioning the nation state as the stage where sovereignty, democracy and identity are carried out. The difference with the industrial revolution is the rapid speed at which the current revolution is taking hold.\nReactionaries take advantage of this fear of change; they close borders; they reject the other, those who are different; they hunker down behind a nationalism without memory of the destruction it wrought in the 20th century. They return to the protectionism of trade wars, and revolt against the technological revolution, using the latter’s own means the better to negate it and to confront its consequences defensively.\nThe function of progressive politics is not to reject or deny technological change\nBut there is something behind the electoral triumphs of people like Trump that reveals the need to introduce elements of governance in globalization so as to make it more predictable, and above all, to make it fairer in terms of redistribution, to rethink the way we work and the time we spend doing it. The function of progressive politics is not to reject or deny technological change, nor to use the fears it generates to go back in time in search of “regressive utopias,” but instead to prepare us to face up to this change by taking advantage of its good aspects and minimizing the risks therein so as not to leave anybody behind.\nThe first society that will pay the price of Trump’s mental walls is America. The good news is that this society is reacting immediately, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2016/11/14/inenglish/1479137822_897610.html?rel=mas\">mobilizing to fight from within</a> against these reactionary and discriminatory instincts installed in the White House since January 20. They are aware that these policies deny the diversity of American society, a diversity that makes it complex but also gives it strength. They are aware that the United States is a society of interconnected minorities in which the imposition of one group over another will only lead to a new “witch hunt,” to an increase in hate crimes toward those seen as different and for that reason to blame. They are aware that hard-won civil rights are in danger. A society built on immigration cannot demonize it.\nReactionaries take advantage of fear of change, they close borders, reject the other\nPerhaps they still don’t realize the economic and social effects of these isolationist and threatening policies. In the walled mind of Trump there is no awareness of what global business means, yet the United States is home to the world’s leading global businesses. These are businesses that produce in the world, looking to reduce costs and looking to find talent where they can. They are companies that sell in the world and prefer free trade. It is obvious that the obligation of politics is to limit abuse through reasonable regulatory frameworks, but not to close borders and spark trade wars.\nAs it is not possible to be a global power without global businesses, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2017/01/20/inenglish/1484921257_352423.html\">the United States will begin its decline as “first power” in the Trump era</a>. It cannot expect that its businesses will manufacture in the United States, that Americans will consume what is produced there and that other countries will continue to consume what its global companies sell.\nHow is he going to apply high import tariffs and return manufacturing to the United States, where it is more expensive, without raising prices for consumers and effectively impoverishing them? How can he lower taxes and increase spending (on infrastructure and defense) without unbalancing the public accounts? He will obviously cut social spending (on health and other areas), thus breaking the bonds of social cohesion.\nDemocracy doesn’t guarantee good government, but it does allow us to change the people who do things badly. Which is why, in the long run, it is always better. Let us keep hope alive!\n<strong>Felipe González</strong> was prime minister of Spain between 1982 and 1996.\nEnglish version by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickLyne\">Nick Lyne</a>."

            "contentBody": "Luis Vallejo happily explains the details of the bonsais on display in the Alcobendas Bonsai Museum. Maples, pines, junipers, olive trees, oaks... He knows the history of each and every one of the 150 trees displayed there - where they came from and the cities in which they resided throughout their long lives.\nVallejo is one of the patriarchs of the bonsai in Spain and he has put his personal stamp on a museum that stands out for the quality and originality of the pieces on show, and for Vallejo's efforts to unite native trees with works of art by Japanese artists known to be among the best cultivators - legendary figures in the bonsai world.\n\"Our collection is one of a kind, probably the best in Europe, and maybe in the western world,\" says Vallejo, standing in front of a juniper designed by Masahiko Kimura, a reputed 20th century master.\nThe museum's creator is also a landscape artist. His company is called Arceval, which in Spanish is a combination of his favorite tree, the arce (or maple) and the first syllable of his last name. Since he was a small boy he has been drawn to these miniature trees planted in trays, which is what the word bonsai means.\n\"Thanks to my garden design business, I can afford to buy trees that cost the same as a luxury car,\" he says, as he stops to examine a very old wild olive tree from the Balearics. When he received it, it was a diamond in the rough.\nCareful and patient grooming, carried out according to the norms of beauty and proportion dictated by Japanese tradition, along with the passage of time have converted a mere tree into a work of art.\n\"These are living beings that we must observe and reflect on before we begin to work on them, using the energy they give off to direct it as it best suits us.\"\nAn uncommon Balearic boxwood tree, a pomegranate with a twisted trunk, a Chinese juniper shaped like a Rubenesque woman, an ancient yew with a hollowed trunk ready to shelter an imaginary bird - the collection does not fail to delight.\nAmong all of the trees, Vallejo has a special regard for the more than 20 donated by politician Felipe González. The \"master gardener\" and his \"disciple prime minister\" worked on many of them together in the prime minister's residence in Moncloa.\n\"One day I came home and my wife said, you'll never guess who's been here to see you.\" It was González, who had left a message asking Vallejo to stop by the palace in Moncloa the following day. Word of Luis Vallejo's fame had reached even the prime minister's ears.\nThe tour of the Alcobendas museum ends in a private area reserved for the 300 trees that are waiting for their moment to shine. They will not be put on display in the museum until they are at their most beautiful. For some of these trees, this means a wait of years. The hobby of bonsai is one for people with a lot of patience. Time is an essential ally. But while waiting, its owner can secretly delight in the beauty of the maturing trees.\nbonsái\nAn elm tree that writer Gabriel García Márquez gave to the museum's creator, Luis Vallejo."

Spain's longest-serving prime minister (1982-1996) is criticizing the conservative government of Mariano Rajoy for allowing what he said amounts to \"a total intervention\" of the Spanish state at \"a low cost\" to the European Union, in reference to the approved bailout of Spain's banking system.\nThe former Socialist leader, considered one of the country's most influential statesmen, also thinks it would be a serious mistake to think that Spain is too big to fail because of the risk to the euro. \"Was not Europe able to destroy itself [in the past]?\" he asks in this interview with EL PAÍS. \"We are adrift, as Spaniards and as Europeans.\"\n<strong>Question.</strong> How did we get to this point?\n<strong>Answer.</strong> [Angela] Merkel says we are paying 10 years' worth of mistakes made by an economic policy based on an enormous real estate bubble. Now that we keep saying she is wrong about everything, we need to admit that yes, she is right about that. She is talking about the 10 years prior to 2008, which is when the world financial system blew up and the real estate bubble burst in Spain. From a Spanish point of view, the unbridled property boom began with the law that freed up land for sale with the banal argument that the greater the land supply, the cheaper the price, as though the markets would be rational. The reality was that land became more expensive by the day, that we built three or four times more square meters than was required by balanced demand, and that we wildly encouraged small-time corruption.\nAngela Merkel is right to focus on the fallout from Spain's property bubble\"\n<strong>Q.</strong> So Spanish decisions are to blame?\n<strong>A.</strong> The responsibility does not lie solely with a bunch of undisciplined people rushing madly along towards a property bubble, as they would have us believe. There is a shared responsibility with regard to a monetary policy that facilitated loans at rates below those of inflation, and that was not the exclusive responsibility of Spanish financial institutions, but also of German ones, French ones... The mistake is ours, but it is a shared one. There's been a terrible construction crisis, but the debt crisis is caused by the banks, which fed that debt irrationally. [...] But things were not the same at the state level. During that same period of time that Merkel is talking about, Spain had much healthier public accounts than Germany and almost any other country. When the bubble burst we had a budget surplus of over two percentage points, and a public debt of under 37 percent of GDP.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Ten back-to-back years of mistakes is a long time, though.\n<strong>A.</strong> All this began with political decisions made from 1998 onwards by [Popular Party government officials] Aznar, Rato and Rajoy, but they were not corrected by the governments that followed in 2004, that is to say by [Socialist Prime Minister] Rodríguez Zapatero. They were not corrected by a government apparently living in an ideal world, with the economy growing at over three percent and loans below inflation levels [...] instead it added fuel to the fire. Of course, all this came with a defective European model for a monetary union without economic union. When it was convenient for us for the interest rate to be reasonable with regard to economic growth and inflation in our country - that is to say, when we needed to cool down that speculative economy - the interest rate was fixed with criteria that did not meet our needs. So the European Central Bank fed the fire we were creating in Spain.\nThe crisis stems from the meltdown of a deregulated financial system\"\n<strong>Q.</strong> Could this Spanish drift have been corrected with a different European policy?\n<strong>A.</strong> At least it would have prevented the dramatic situation that Spain and Italy find themselves in, and by extension the entire monetary union. Complete correction has its difficulties. If you look at the United States, you see that a single currency with divergent economic policies caused a tremendous panic in the late 19th century, which led to the creation of the Federal Reserve. Today, the state of California cannot balance its budget. So how does it finance its debt? Through the Federal Reserve, at negative interest rates. Obviously, they will have to do some serious restructuring, but the Fed prevents speculation from wiping out California, just like it does with Florida. It's not like here, where the European Central Bank does not act like a central bank.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Neither are we a federation.\nWe are now seeing the same banking practices again that led to the trauma\"\n<strong>A.</strong> We are not a federation and we do not have a central bank that acts as such, I insist. Spain has a deficit and debt figures well below those of Britain, and yet Britain finances itself through the Bank of England at very low interest rates while Spain finances itself at unbearably high yields, because the ECB does not act like a central bank, but it does prevent national banks from acting as such. This is an asymmetrical restriction because it tremendously favors countries like Germany and its closest partners, while it hurts others just as tremendously. So we could say that to talk about a single European currency is almost an exercise in political-fiction. There is one euro with completely different assessments in the markets. In California, independently of California's debt, the dollar is the same as the dollar from New York. But in Alicante the euro is more expensive than in Frankfurt.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Is that what happened with the monetary union?\n<strong>A.</strong> We need to remember that all this is taking place in a context that we have forgotten about already, namely that the origin of this crisis is in the meltdown of a deregulated global financial system. There was a rescue of that deregulated financial system, and that was done at the taxpayer's expense, not just in terms of the bailout itself but also to pay the consequences of the deep recession caused by that financial crisis - once all that was done, it turns out that the things that caused the crisis remain untouched. We are now seeing the same practices that led to the crisis, and suddenly you read that J.P. Morgan has lost another few billion euros.\n<strong>Q.</strong> Why is that happening?\n<strong>A.</strong> I'll give you a personal opinion. Because the displacement of real power in the last 25 years from our democratic representatives to the financial decision centers has not been reverted."

            "contentBody": "The interview recently given by the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González to EL PAÍS, published on Sunday, is being used by the Popular Party (PP) to attack the Zapatero government, and in particular the deputy prime minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba. The PP's arguments rest on an interpretation of Gonzalez's words that falsifies what he really said. At no point in the interview did he admit, implicitly or explicitly, to having been ultimately responsible for the dirty war against ETA, as the PP leaders argue, in order to serve their own interests. He admits, rather, to having been the one who tried to prevent the war from taking place.\nAs the courts established at the time, individuals occupying posts in the administration were responsible for crimes, for which they were convicted. But this does not mean that the state as such, in its institutional chain of command, had anything to do with the crimes.\nTo ignore this important qualification is not only to twist the meaning of what the courts then considered proven, but also to disregard the complex conditions prevailing in the transition from Franco's dictatorship to our present system of liberties. A dirty war existed before the González governments, and onward until 1986. If there were no episodes of it under the subsequent PP governments, this was simply because they found the sinister problem solved, not because their civic virtues were any greater than those of their predecessors.\nThe spurious reasons for which the PP now wishes to resuscitate the old ghosts of the dirty war, have to do with the only thing that seems to motivate it: the anxiety to attain power at any price. It did this when the courts began to investigate the dirty war (having remained silent when the war was going on), and its present intention is to do so once more.\nBut one essential circumstance has changed. At this moment the terrorist organization which - from the opposite side to that which attempted a right-wing coup in 1981 - unsuccessfully aimed at putting an end to the democratic system, is now in a situation of extreme weakness. To hark back to these old episodes is to give ETA a boost free of charge, all the more so when they are being used merely on the political level. If the PP is so certain that the remarks of ex-Prime Minister González are tantamount to a confession, it ought to take the matter to the courts, and not make hypocritical noises in front of microphones and cameras.\nIn view of the critical point at which the anti-terrorist struggle now stands, mere civic responsibility calls for recognition of the fact that the killers profit, among other things, from dissensions between the democratic political parties. The dissension that the PP is now trying to arouse benefits no one, except the terrorists.\nIt would seem unacceptable if, for the sake of electoral mileage, the Spanish democratic system were to lose this new opportunity to eliminate a blight that has plagued it since its origin, and has more than once placed it in tight corners in the course of its existence. It is in this sense exactly, and in no other, that the remarks of Felipe González were intended."

Stumping for Tomás Gómez and Jaime Lissavetzky, running for Madrid regional premier and mayor, respectively, González attacked the PP for using ETA terrorism as a campaign weapon.\n\"I would never have imagined that they would use terrorist violence so irresponsibly and cynically,\" said González. \"In democratic terms, anyone who capitalizes on terror doesn't deserve the trust of the people.\"\nAznar campaigned in Castilla-La Mancha, expected to be one of the biggest political battlefields as the PP tries to wrest the regional government away from the Socialists' José María Barreda.Aznar spoke Sunday night at arally for María Dolores de Cospedal, who is running against Barreda.\nMeanwhile, his former interior minister, Ángel Acebes, said the Constitutional Court's decision on Thursday to allow Bildu to participate in the race was \"a huge setback\" for the nation. Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, campaigning for Socialist candidates in Gijón, warned that the PP, if it comes to power next year, will dismantle all the programs the Socialists have introduced.\nSpaniards go to the polls on May 22 to elect regional and local leaders in what is seen as a vote on Zapatero's government."

His lawyers said he is in solitary confinement.\nLast month, Venezuelan <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/20/inenglish/1424427442_337332.html\">secret police barged into Mayor Ledezma’s offices</a> and took him after Maduro accused the opposition of trying to overthrow his government.\nTintori and Ledezma’s wife, Mitzy Capriles, have been conducting an international campaign to seek the release of their husbands.\nAlso on Monday, one of Ledezma’s daughters was briefly detained by anti-drug officers at Caracas’s Simón Bolívar International Airport. Her passport was returned and she was allowed to travel after being held for questioning for around an hour.\nFor her part, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/11/27/inenglish/1417104997_369476.html\">former lawmaker María Corina Machado</a>, said González’s involvement in the cases shows “to what extent the perception of the crisis is changing in the international community.”\n“Today we are aware that we can count on Spanish democrats. Leopoldo López, Antonio Ledezma, Daniel Ceballos [another mayor being held] and other political prisoners not only represent a part of society but the struggle of a people against a dictatorship that has criminal connections,” she said.\nGonzález’s announcement was also welcomed by many Latin American political figures, including former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\n“The time has come for democratic voices, especially the Latin American democratic governments to protest the abuses being carried out by the government of Venezuela,” he said.\nChile’s former President Sebastián Piñeda predicted that González would “shed some light for the world about the deep crisis that is confronting Venezuela.”\n“At the same time, his participation will serve as an incentive to put an end to the indifference, the silence and the complicity by many governments who have observed this crisis,” Piñera said.\n“The fact that a former Spanish prime minister and ex-Socialist leader will assume the defense of two political prisoners in Venezuela is a powerful symbol,” he said.\nIn 1977 González successfully intervened in the case of two political prisoners held by late dictator Augusto Pinochet\nThe former Chilean president traveled to Caracas along with former Colombian leader Andrés Pastrana in January to visit López in prison, but the Venezuelan police stopped them from going in.\nMaduro criticized the trip by the two former leaders, who were able to meet with human rights victims and journalists before leaving Caracas.\n“We could see with our own eyes what was happening so we were able to formulate a clear and strong opinion,” he said.\nOutgoing Organization of American States (OAS) secretary-general José Miguel Insulza said González’s involvement would help López, Ledezma and other prisoners secure guarantees in their defense if not their release.\nAnother former Chilean president, Ricardo Lago, recalled when González intervened in the case of two political prisoners held by the late dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n“In 1977, Felipe González came to Chile to intercede on behalf of two political prisoners, Erick Schnake and Carlos Lazo. It was a successful trip. Now, many years later, with a complicated and difficult situation in Venezuela, where a political solution is needed, Felipe González is once again opening the way. We wish him luck,” said Lagos.\nThe Maduro government did not immediately react to González’s actions. The Venezuelan Embassy in Madrid has called a news conference with several ruling party deputies."
